A good marinade for this dish is chopped garlic, a dash of soy sauce, salt, and a little oil. Even an hour of marinating makes a big difference. Stick the meat in the fridge to marinade. Overnight would be even better. If you want to skip the marinade, no worries; just be prepared to work those jaw muscles.  When you're ready to cook, sauté the garlic in the oil for a few seconds in a large skillet or wok, and then add the sliced beef.
